====================================
Account Anglo Saxon no COGS deferral
====================================

This module invalidates the COGS deferral introduced by the Anglo Saxon
Accounting module.

In companies that send the customer invoice at the time of shipping the
products the COGS deferral method is not really required, and makes an added
complexity to accounting to make sure that there are no imbalances in the
COGS deferral account.
